I had told myself going in that I was going to exert a 5/5 effort but at my 10 I found myself changing my mind. My philosophy is that running should still be fun and I don't know if it is worth it to go 100% if I am wasted at the end. I pushed myself to keep driving my legs but I didn't push into the pain/misery zone. This race was a bit disorganized at the start and the shirt was kind of a gross mustard color. But it was super fun that I ran with Christian and he took first in his age group with a time of 1:57! So Paige, Aubrey, Dad, Mom, and Mayah were cheering us on at the finish.",

I felt so happy and proud with my expected time that I never really \"pushed\" myself into the next gear and instead ran strong and felt good. I told myself in my mind that I would be more than happy with a sub 3:15 and that I could allow some room to PR next race (that said, my calves were shredded and it was hard to walk after the race so I clearly exerted myself more than it felt in the moment). The finish felt so good and I saw and heard my family cheering me on and then I walked straight up to Paige and hugged her and we both started crying a bit. She said she as so proud of me and amazed and that feeling combined with the emotional relief of training so hard and smashing my goal made for an emotional experience. The best part is that I still don't feel like I've peaked. I only averaged around 30 miles while training (maxed at 40), so my potential is so much greater if I increase my mileage to the 60 miles that Boston Qualifiers are averaging. Boston is now definitely in striking distance!",
    "nutrition": "Took Black Chery Clif Chews every ~4 miles with water at aid stations (5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 23). Sipped gatorade at most of the other stations. Race day breakfast was 1/2 cup oatmeal with honey and 1 piece of toast. Legit drank close to two gallons of water the day before and almost peed my pants on the drive down but felt fully hydrated. Friday morning had a ton of oatmeal plus 2 bagels, whole weat pasta noodles with marinara and spinach for lunch, double wrapped Chipotle burritto for dinner (with Sofritas). Started carb loading on Monday and had a lot of rice and some potato meals. Big Cafe Rio burrito Thursday night. Also made sure to have 1 gallon of water per day for the week. Also took Athletic Green supplements for about a month leading up to the race.",

Yet, I did set some general rules to prevent another collapse like I saw in the later miles of my last marathon from going out too fast. I ran without music for the first 9 miles and only turned it on after I climbed the Veyo hill. I promised myself I wouldn't push myself before Mile 10 and I kept a steady pace up the hill. I also had a goal to run the second half faster than the first half which I failed to achieve but still think I did a decent job holding myself back in the early miles. Specifically for the St. George Marathon if and when I do it again, here was the mental milestones I set up for myself: \n\nMiles 1-6: run easy and inuitively while focusing on breathing, Miles 7-10: hill climb take it slow and steady and save your energy for the downhills to come, Miles 11-13: turn on music and celebrate that the big hills are behind you, Miles 13-24: Run strong and know that the biggest downhills are coming at miles 20, 22, 15, 14, Miles 25-26: Turn off music and feel the energy of the spectators and focus on your form and cycling your legs.",

    "key_learnings": "1. Do more uphill training (course has more rolling hills than I expected) 2. Dumping water on my head at aid stations helped keep my body cool 3. It is easier to pace without music (I felt more in control of my breathing and aware of my effort) 4. It is worth it to hold yourself back in the early miles to have a strong finish. 5. Break the race down into smaller milestones (see pacing column for detail)",

Ended up barely running a sub 7 minutes so I was very pleased about that!  Also, this was my first time running a race with Dalan and he has been trash talking that he was going to beat me. I was a little nervous because he has been putting down some good times on his training runs. But I ended up surging at the end and beat him by about a minute. The only disappointment that would have made it a perfect race is that I took 4th place by only 8 seconds! If I knew I was only 8 seconds behind then I definitely could have dug deeper and beat that time. That is the hard part about racing for a placement medal--there is no way of knowing if someone is in your division or if their chip time started before or after. But overall proud of my time and performance and there will be futue placement medals for me to win!",
    "nutrition": "Black Cherry chews at Mile 4, 8, 11 (planned to take more frequently but stomach didn't want it--spit out mile 11 after a minute or so). Conclusion--you don't need as many as you think for a half. Drank 1-2 gallons of water the few days before. Sleep wasn't great since we are still waking up with a newborn in the middle of the night. Stuck to Spaghetti and spinach night before, Chipotle burrito for lunch, tons of oatmeal for breakfast, Cafe Rio burrito two nights before. Race day breakfast of oatmeal, honey, toast.",
    "strategy_pacing_mantras": "I really like the strategy of no music until the halfway point (mile 6.5). It really helps me run focused on my breathe and my body for the first half while giving me something to look forward to. And then when the music comes on I do feel like it gives me a boost to kick it into a higher gear. I also tried to break the 13 miles down into 3 mile segments by taking a chew at each, but changed course to avoid stomach discomfort. I wasn't paying attention to my pace during the run and instead was just running at a strong but sutainable pace. I think the thing I would incorporate next time is to focus on running the last 3 miles with my legs and strong running form (kick off from big toe and hips down)",
    "limiting_factor": "My legs felt fine after this race and the limiting factor from going much faster was my cardio. So work on increasing VO2 max through fast runs. Also, my stomach was a bit upset after crossing the finish line which might have been due to eating breakfast only 1.5 hours before or from taking too many chews. Experiment with eating less if you can't speed up for fear of throwing up.",
    "key_learnings": "I could have still probably pushed harder at the end before my final sprint (which was strong). Remember when you have three miles left to run with your legs (pushing off of big toe) and find someone ahead of you to chase them down. If I would have done that, I would have easily taken third. It was a frigid day and I spent a lot of time stressing the night before and morning of about what to wear. Temperature at start time was 23 degrees with wind chill at 18 degrees. I planned to wear a running jacket but at the last second I switched to my \"Run\" tshirt which I'm so glad I did because I would have been too hot in anything thicker. So my outfit was shorts, tshirt, and earmuff headband. My only regret is that I should have also worn by thin running gloves because my hands were numb by mile two and I couldn't grab the water cups (accidentally pushed a cup of powerade on a volunteers hands!). Key learning is that it is even in cold temparatures, race in shorts but keep the hands and ears covered because that is where most of the heat escapes. ",

I was hardly breathing when I crossed the finish and didn't at all feel sore. I also ran with Alphaflys for the first time and I LOVED them. It felt like running on clouds and my turnover felf fast and natural. About a month ago I attempted to run 13 miles in under 7:00 pace and did so at 6:55/mi and it really took it out of me. So for this tune-up race, I was expecting to be under 7:00 and thought to myself that I would be very happy with 6:40 and that I would be shocked if I ran 6:30. And then 6:04 WTF?? Big disclaimer: my pace on Strava was 6:21/mi because I only ran 8.9 miles. Seems that the course was short. But still--6:21 is might fast for 9 miles and I'm so proud of that effort!\n\nThere was a group of 6 guys leading the race and running together and I was maybe 100 meters behind them but I kept them in my sight the entire race. It was so fun to finish and for it to be empty except for us fast dudes for like ten minutes until the bigger group started coming in.I didn't want to push myself too hard in this tune-up race, but I think I'm to the point where I can try to stick with the lead group and run with others to have them help me push the pace. But again, it also felt so good to just run my pace and to feel strong but in control.",
    "nutrition": "Took one Black Cherry chew five minutes before the race and then ran with two in my pocket that I never touched. Felt strong and worried that my stomach would be upset. Didn't stop for water this time either. It was a short race but I with how fit I am, I want to be careful not to overdo chews and water. I think taking too many chews might be why my stomach is often upset after races, but it wasn't at all upset after this 15k.",
    "strategy_pacing_mantras": "Great pacing this race evidenced by my very consistent heart rate and splits. I didn't turn on music until mile 1.5 to prevent myself from going out to fast and so I wanted to take the first mile easy. Didn't really work and I ended up running the first mile at 6:06 BUT my heart rate was the lowest of the race. It is so easy to go out fast because of the adrenaline even if my heart rate is down. So rather than focusing on my pace for the first mile, focus on keeping your heart rate relaxed and ideally below 150. Then ramp up with the music!",
    "limiting_factor": "The only limiting effort here was that I didn't push 100% because my goal is the marathon. But my legs were fine, breathing sustained, and I felt fresh as a daisy after the race.",

So I was pretty bummed that the weather was so terrible because I was too paranoid about wearing my new Alphaflys. Which was actually kind of a good thing because then I was able to run more casually without pushing to my limit. But then annoyingly my watch was super wrong on pacing the entire race. Everytime I looked it said I was running a 7+ minute pace... but I was like oh well this weather is garbage so I'll just keep moving along. But then when I hit 11 miles I looked at my total time and it was like 1 hour and 7 minutes. And when I realized that my watch must be wrong, I got a burst of adrenaline and was able to push it strong to the finish. I think the issue is that on my Strava app, I accidentally selected \"Start Bike\" which showed me miles per hour rather than pace. So I was quite shocked to find that I ran in the 6 minute range for all my splits except three--where I ran in the 5 minute range! Overall I did not like the course very much... there were some steep hills and at one point it felt like I was running uphill on a straight, never-ending road for like 4 miles. But my feet were soaking wet and my hands were numb so that probably didn't help my mood. So overall this would have been a pretty negative race experience... except that I somehow PR'd in the terrible conditions?! Makes me pretty excited that my fitness is better than it has ever been and I'm just praying that conditions will be much better for the Ogden full next month! ",

I think it really helped to run easy for two and then I turned on my music to run to 180 bpm and I started quickly passing people. And once again, running at the faster cadence somehow feels even easier than running with my longer strides.",

I think I could have chosen to push a bit harder in the last 10K but I just told myself \"what's the point\"? I've worked so hard to break 3 hours and I am now doing it by a large margin, and that is good enough for now. It felt a little arbitrary to push myself to my limits to potentially get a few minutes or seconds faster. After the race, I was reflecting on how last year after running 3:11, I was so pumped and motivated that sub-3 was in striking distance and I was ready to get back on the road and start training basically the next day. But after this marathon, while very proud of myself, I don't feel that same hunger. But maybe that is okay? I am excited to run Boston in the Spring  and will start training for that in December. But I am going to take at least a week off from running. While these emotions of borderline apatahy are a bit scary because I don't want to lose the competitive drive to keep improving and pushing my limits, on the other hand it is freeing and exciting that I can continue to run for fun and run races fast without having to stress about hitting a certain time. Maybe at some point when I start training again, I will want to really focus on hitting a time goal, but for now I am going to take some time to really live in the moment and appreciate how amazing it is that I ran two sub-3 marathons in 2022!\n\nNow that I am getting more races under my belt, I tried to forecast my splits based on the elevation and I nailed with an estimate of 2:53! (See 2022 St. George tab) Though there was a lot of luck in that since my actual mile splits were a bit all over the place. I thought I did a very good job of pacing the first half though in that my effort felt relatively easy and I was consciously holding myself back, especially on the hill climbs. However, I still ran some sub 6 minute miles during the first 13. So did I actually still go out too fast? I find myself more in the camp of racing by effort rather than pace, but I've seen people argue that it is better to have even splits throughout the race. So I may have some lessons to learn but I didn't feel like I went out too fast. I felt great up until mile 18 and thought I was going to negative split. Now that I think about it, my issue might have been pushing too hard in miles 14-16. Because when I hit mile 18, there was a bit of a hill climb and all the sudden I just felt fatigued. It wasn't like my legs were directly tired or cramping, but I just felt exhausted... so I slowed down a lot. And that is when I started to have the mental debate of how important it was for me to push past the fatigue. I'm glad I took it relatively easy from 18 to the finish because I still got a big PR and felt generally okay after finishing. I wouldn't necessarily say I \"hit the wall\" at mile 18 because I was still able to keep going at a decent pace. But more that I realized racing 26 miles is more than doubly as hard as racing 13 miles because the body gets exponential more fatigued. But as I have seen thus far, I'm sure as I continue to train that I will go further before hitting this point. ",
    "nutrition": "Timing of this race wasn't super ideal in that I was at a company offsite event in Boulder, CO the week of the race. So I didn't have my typical carb feasting plan I do at home, but I still think I adequately carb loaded by eating bagels and rice packets in my hotel room after skipping the meat-heavy lunches. \nTook a Cliff block at miles 0, 7, 13, 17 and planned to take one at 22 but didn't. Also I took non-caffeinated at 0 and 7 and then caffeinated Black Cherry at 13 and 17. I didn't have any stomach problems so I think this was a good call.",

Energy systems decided 18 miles of 6:30/mi pace was enough, so consistency and increased mileage is probably the way to improve this. Legs felt pretty strong throughout the race. Hill climbs caused me some mental fatigue but not as much as last year so there was some improvement there.",
    "key_learnings": "1. Racing by \"feel\" rather than time goals is probably the most sustainable and enjoyable way to run marathons. I want to keep getting faster, but now that I am sub-3, finish time is a bit arbitrary. 2. My long-term racing goal is to start winning my age group. That will be a stronger motivator than finish time if I want to push my limits.",

The race was so well organized and I met so many runners from around the world and it felt like a huge celebration all weekend. So vibes = 100/100. But man I blew up early and had to walk a few times and basically joggedf the last 8 miles which was frustrating. Luckily, I didn't have a time goal going into it, so I wasn't too upset. But it still never feels great to run 40 minutes slower than PR especially becaues all of my training runs had gone so well! 5 weeks before the race I ran 16 miles at 6:40 average pace. So I really thought I was super fit despite a lower training volume. I think the major lesson I learned though is that I didn't train very well for the race conditions. All my marathon pace runs were on the flat murdock trail and early in the morning in cold conditions. But race day in Boston was super sunny, hot, and hilly. The race didn't start until 10 am and at that point I was already sweating in the sun. And my HR spiked at 175 very early which I should have been watching it more closely to slow down due to the heat. So argh yeah the race could have gone better and I am itching to improve and push my body a bit more for the next one. I think part of the reason I struggled in this race also is that I went in with the wrong mindset assuming that it would be \"easy\" and \"enjoyable\". I wasn't ready for the pain which made it way harder to deal with. I didn't really have any specific physical pain. Instead it was just like an overall deep fatigue and mental pain forcing myself to run. After finishing my vision started going blurry and so they took me to the medical tent to recovery. So I clearly pushed myself pretty close to the limit and am proud of myself for still running when I just wanted to walk the last 6 miles. But I was listening to a podcast today about how sometimes you need a bad race to make you more hungry for the next one. And that is where I'm at. This was honestly a good race for this to happen because I still enjoyed the experience. But I'm ready to focus on performance and to hit some time goals. Overall so grateful that I got to the start line healthy this year though and that I got to achieve this dream. Strava post has a more coherent recap.",

That said I'm proud of myself for still pushing and achieving my realistic B goal of sub 1:20. Running fell lower on my priority list this year but glad I still have it in me to bomb down a mountain and take 3rd place in my division.",
